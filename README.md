# ‚≠ê Community Vault

### ‚≠ê Project Description

Community Vault is a decentralized social platform built on the Andromeda Testnet. It reimagines a social feed where content is truly owned by its creator. Each post, complete with an image and text, is minted as a unique NFT on the blockchain, creating a permanent and uncensorable record. This project serves as a proof-of-concept for a new generation of community-governed applications.

### ‚≠ê Project Vision

The long-term vision for the Community Vault is to evolve into a fully-fledged Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The goal is to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where the community not only creates the content but also governs the platform. Future versions will empower users to vote on proposals, manage a collective treasury funded by on-chain rewards, and truly own the platform they help build. This project aims to be a foundation for a more transparent, fair, and collaborative digital society.

### ‚≠ê Key Features

-   **NFT as Content:** Create posts with a title, content, and an image, which are then minted as a CW721 NFT on the Andromeda Testnet.
-   **On-Chain Data:** The main feed fetches and displays all post-NFTs directly from our custom smart contract.
-   **Decentralized Storage:** All post images and metadata are uploaded to IPFS via Pinata for permanent, decentralized storage.
-   **Web3 Wallet Integration:** Seamlessly connect with the Keplr wallet to interact with the platform.
-   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript for a fast, modern, and type-safe user experience.

### ‚≠ê Future Scope

-   **On-Chain Tipping & Rewards:** Implementing a direct peer-to-peer reward system.
-   **DAO & Treasury Management:** Introducing a community-governed treasury and on-chain voting for proposals.
-   **Rich Social Features:** Building out a richer social experience with on-chain comments, emoji reactions, and user profiles.
